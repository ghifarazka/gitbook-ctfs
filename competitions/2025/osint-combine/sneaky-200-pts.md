# Sneaky! (200 pts)

> On which date did an Instagram account with the handle @iceland post a video warning viewers that Icelandâ€™s sneaker waves are no joke? _Answer is a date in the format ddmmyyyy i.e. 15012012_

### Solution

Following the description, we can Google the search term `site:instagram.com/iceland "Iceland" "sneaker waves" "joke"` .  From this, we found the [post](https://www.instagram.com/iceland/reel/C5qpqdYLvVW/) in question.

Now, the rest should be as easy as submitting the post's upload date... or so I thought.

Apparently, 12 April 2024 is **not** the correct answer. At first, I started to doubt if this is even the correct post. However, after an additional search effort, the post referred to in the description could only be this one.

At one moment, I realized something. Instagram shows me the upload date (and [time](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/bOAnhsdDduI)!) of the post based on my timezone. This means that other than 12 April, 11 and 13 April are also possible solutions as well. And so, I tried submitting the three of them. It turned out that the correct answer is **13 April 2024**.&#x20;

Later, I know why this is the case. OSINT Combine is based in Australia, so the folks who created the challenges must have used the Australian timezone (which is earlier than most timezones) when they were making the challenges :).
