> A shark called Rocket was last tracked near a small island nation. Which country is it? _Answer is the name of the country, lowercase, i.e. panama_

### Solution

My first approach on this was to find a shark named "Rocket", but it led to many different sharks as a result. From there, however, I realized that these sharks who are being 'tracked' by scientists are likely to be put on a database or map that are accessible by public. So, I searched for `list of tracked sharks`  on Google and found this [shark tracking website](https://www.ocearch.org/tracker/?list=).

I immediately searched for a shark named **Rocket** and found this.

Rocket was last recorded to be in the country of Vanuatu.
