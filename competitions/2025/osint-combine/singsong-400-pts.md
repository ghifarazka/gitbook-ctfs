# Singsong (400 pts)

> Ah, nothing like listening to the sounds of nature! The bird who sings this song has two colours in its name - what are they? _Answer is two words with a space between, lowercase. List them in alphabetical order i.e. green purple_

### Solution

We are given a `.mov` file which contains audio only. Here it is after I converted it to `.mp3`.

{% file src="../../../.gitbook/assets/birdsong.mp3" %}

After doing some Googling, I learned that there are many bird sound recognizer app out there, and almost all of them are mobile apps. I tried downloading some, but eventually sticked with [Merlin Bird ID](https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/) because it has a feature where you can upload an audio file to identify the bird, instead of using microphone to record an audio.

Here is the front page view. Click on "My Sound Recordings".

Then, click the three dots on the corner to import a sound file.

After this, the app will ask for a location. For this, just pick a random location. If the app can't recognize the bird, try another location by clicking the three dots in the corner and selecting "Change Location".

When the location is set to the US, this result is shown.

We can verify it by listening to the samples of the bird's sound. Also, the challenge mentioned that the bird's name has two color names, and this one matches that description.

Flag: `black red`
