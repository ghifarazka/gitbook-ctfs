# High Seas (300 pts)

> A trawler identified as ‘Starfish’ has been suspected of illegal fishing. Its last known position was near the Gulf of Guinea. Which country's flag does the trawler operate under? _Answer is the country name, lowercase i.e. egypt_

### Solution

This challenge is similar to [shadow-fleet-200-pts.md](shadow-fleet-200-pts.md "mention"). We could again visit [vesselfinder.com](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels) to get more information about the ship mentioned in the description. Here, there are several possibilities.

After checking each ship one-by-one, it's only the ship under the Nigerian flag whose last position was in the Gulf of Guinea.
