### Solution

We are given this image.

Too dark? It is. Doing reverse image search using this image won't return anything useful. First of all, we need to do some image manipulation. Here, I increased the brightness, contrast, and the saturation of the image.

Using this image, we found the original image, along with the name of the animal (**potoo**).

Flag: `potoo`
