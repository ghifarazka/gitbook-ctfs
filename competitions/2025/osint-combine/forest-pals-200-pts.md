> Which orangutan was telling a story on the Borneo Orangutan Survival (BOS) Foundationâ€™s website in 2012? _Answer is a one word name, lowercase, i.e. naomi_

### Solution

First of all, we could Google "Borneo Orangutan Survival (BOS) Foundation website" to get the domain, [orangutan.or.id](https://www.orangutan.or.id/).

To see how the website looked like in 2012, we could use the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20120101000000*/https://www.orangutan.or.id/). Since the description only says "2012", just try each date until we get the answer.
