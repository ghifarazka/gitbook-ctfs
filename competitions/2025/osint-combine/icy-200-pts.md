> Behold, the power of nature! This [Tiktok video](https://www.tiktok.com/@momentscary8/video/7423735322502024468?q=%23naturaldisaster\&t=1741755163664) captures ice surged onto shore in front of spectators. On which river did this event occur? _Answer is the name of the river, one word, lowercase i.e. nile_

### Solution

The Tiktok post where the video resides mentions that the phenomenon is called "Ice Tsunami". Moreover, watching the video, we could observe some Cyrillic text, indicating that the video was (most likely) taken in Russia. Therefore, we could try searching "ice tsunami in Russia" in Google.&#x20;

Here, we see that the exact same video was uploaded on Facebook and YouTube as well. Interestingly, they mentioned the name of the river where the phenomenon took place: the Yenisei River in Russia.
