Question: What number should the thief call to reduce the electricity bill?

### Solution

Now we know that the Thief is heading to Mexico City, and from the post, it seems that he's gonna land  soon. To answer the question, we need to geolocate this place.

First of all, since he's gonna land soon, it's a good idea to go to Google Maps and look for matches starting from areas near the airport. We can mark down unique parts from the image and match them with the satellite image. For example, there's the long dark rectangle on the bottom left, a square looking city grid next to the long rectangle (where the bright lights is in), and another dark spot further back.

By scouring the Google Maps, we eventually find a match. The long rectangular dark spot is [Panteon san Isidro (a cemetary)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3dxJBqN6q7F7QwdHA). And the other dark spot consist of some parks. This area is located about 17 kilometers northwest from the airport.

Here's a more lined up perspective, matching the view from the airplane.

Just next to the cemetary, where the bright lights came from, is a stadium. It's obvious that a stadium would need a very bright lighting when used during night time.
