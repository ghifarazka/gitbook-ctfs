Question: What is the full name of the photographer?

### Solution

Right now, Santa immediately blames someone whom he knew had photographed him three years ago. This is not the right thing to do, as we need further evidence to even begin to suspect anyone.&#x20;

Regardless, we can go to "Finnish National Circus Social Media" and look for photos taken in December 2021 (three years ago). After some [Googling](https://sirkusfinlandia.fi/en/home/), we know that the circus has a Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. Searching through Instagram, we finally found [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/CX08mh9NtnA/) image of Santa and Rudolph posted in 23 December 2021.

The name of the photographer is clearly visible in the bottom left corner.
