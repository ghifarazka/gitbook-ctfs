Question: When was the thief born?

### Solution

Seeing describing words such as "powerful star", "bull", and "fire dragon" led us to believe that The Thief  is talking about horoscope.&#x20;

By doing some Googling, we understand that "bull" means "Taurus", which means that The Thief was born between April 20 - May 20. From "fire dragon", we know that The Thief was born in the year of Fire Dragon, which, considering that he's alive in 2024, means that he was born in 1976.

Now, The Thief mentioned that in his 10th birthday, which would be in 1986, there was a big event that forces everyone to stay home. We can Google what that event was.

Finally, we can conclude that The Thief was born in 26 April 1976.
