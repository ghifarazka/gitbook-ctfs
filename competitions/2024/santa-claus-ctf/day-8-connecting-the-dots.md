Question: What is the stage name of the thief?

### Solution

We can directly search #CircusSantaCrusher in Google and get the Thief's X/Twitter account (The X in X-Mas might be a clue that the hashtag belongs to X and not other social media sites).

We can also search it inside X itself.

This, however, was not the case when I first did this challenge. The result was not indexed yet by Google or even X, so it wasn't possible to find the post using only Google search or searching inside Twitter. I tried using other search engine such as Yandex, which gave me this result: [https://www.sotwe.com/search/CircusSantaCrusher](https://www.sotwe.com/search/CircusSantaCrusher) (you might need VPN to open this site).

Sotwe is a third-party X/Twitter viewer. This came as a surprise to me as this third-party website was able to return the result when at that time, the actual X/Twitter website wasn't able to get the same result.&#x20;

Anyways, here is The Thief's X profile. "Gabriel the Clown" is his stage name.
