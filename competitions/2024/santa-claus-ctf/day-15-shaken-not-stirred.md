Question: What did the thief ordered?

### Solution

This challenge confused me at first, but it just showed me the importance of keeping track of all the information that we got during OSINT investigation, and we have to keep updated with changes related to those information.&#x20;

Remember how we found The Thief's X account? He just posted a new tweet.

That's it. That's our answer.
