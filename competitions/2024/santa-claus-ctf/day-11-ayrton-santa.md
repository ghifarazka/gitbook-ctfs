Question: Where did the thief learn how to drive the sleigh?

### Solution

From the data, the only interesting thing we can look at is the email. If we have an email address, we can find any informations associated with that email address using tools like [https://epieos.com/](https://epieos.com/).

Here's what Epieos found.

It might be that The Thief once reviewed the place where he learned how to drive the sleigh on Google Maps, or that he put the place on Google Calendar to schedule his training. In this case, the latter is true.

We can search for that address on Google and get the name of the place.
