Question: The thief is not only pretending to be Santa Claus, but also quoting who?

### Solution

In the boarding pass picture, there is a barcode. We can read that barcode using Google Lens.

It seems that The Thief had left the airport and is now somewhere warmer than Finland. Anyways, The Thief quoted "Hasta la vista, baby!" which was first coined by the Terminator.
