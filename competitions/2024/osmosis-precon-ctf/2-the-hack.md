# # 2 The Hack

> What is the hackers password? To tool or not to tool....

We are given 2 video file, `the_warning.mp4` and `video1517330724.mp4`. The question for this challenge is "the hacker's password". When we play the 'warning' video, we can see this:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We can clearly see the word "PASSWORD" and "MEOW55$55" as stickers. We can assume that that is the hacker's password. Upon submitting, we can see that it's indeed correct. We can assume that the other video is just a red herring.

Flag: `flag{MEOW55$55}`
