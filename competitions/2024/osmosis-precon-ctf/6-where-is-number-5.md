This is a challenge that requires you to become an OSMOSIS member, as the answer can be found in member-only section of [osmosisinstitute.org](https://osmosisinstitute.org). The description mentions "group", which is a thing in the osmosis website (a member can join multiple groups).&#x20;

That means it is implied that "kiberVolk" is an OSMOSIS member, perhaps it's his username. In the website, we can access anyone's profile by entering this URL: [https://osmosisinstitute.org/members/username/](https://osmosisinstitute.org/members/will_mechler/). We can just input "kiberVolk" and get this:

We can see the group he's in here:
