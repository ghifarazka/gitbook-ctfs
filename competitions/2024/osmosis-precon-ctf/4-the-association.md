I assumed that OSMOSIS is an acronym/initialism, so it stands for something. I tried google dorking with the keyword below and found a website:

According to the website, the flag should be "Online Social Media & Open Source Investigation Summit". But it was incorrect. I tried to ask via ticket, and it's said that my answer is almost correct, and that the correct answer turned out to use the word "Investigators", not "Investigation".

Flag: `flag{Online Social Media & Open Source Investigators Summit}`
